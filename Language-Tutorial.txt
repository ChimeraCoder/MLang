\section{Introduction}
This document is a tutorial introduction to programming in MLang. Familiarity with functional programming languages and a basic knowledge of music is preferred but not required. 

\section{Data Types}
The basic data type in MLang is an MNote. An MNote is a list of length 1 and can be thought of as a function with no arguments.\newline
An MNote can be represented as \%A, where A refers to any musical note.\newline
$>$ \%A \newline
^We need to specify the duration, otherwise how long will the note be played? Something more like %(A 500), right?
~note.midi 

When a user enters a single note, the note is evaluated as a function and returns a midi file that contains the musical equivalent of the note.

\section{Input and Output}
The input would consist of one or more notes (Frequency and time), instruments (*are we decided on this*)
^ Instruments depend on what the local midi synthesizer can generate, so we can't make any guarantees on that - it's system-dependent.

The output would be a .midi file which you can play and listen to.

\section{MLang Expressions}
The common form of an MLang expression is a function application given by the syntax 
(function arg1 arg2 ...) 
where the arguments can be MNotes or other functions

\subsection{Functions as values}
Since MLang is a functional language, functions can be treated as data that can be passed around.
^ That's not because it's a functional language; it's because it's a homoiconic language. Most functional languages don't have this functionality - it's only if the internal representation (AST, or whatever, etc.) is an elementary data type in the language.
In MLang, all functions are evaluated to notes. Thus every function eventually is evaluated to a string of notes that forms the midi.

\section{Writing Your first MLang Program}
A program in MLang is nothing but a sequence of functions. A simple program to play a trill would look like this-

$>$(play (trill C))
.midi ---$>$ alternating B \& C

The file can be written in any editor and should be saved as something like trill.mlang. (*I wasnt sure on this*)
