\section{Introduction}
This document is a tutorial introduction to programming in MLang. Familiarity with functional programming languages and a basic knowledge of music is preferred but not required. 

\section{Data Types}
The basic data type in MLang is an MNote. An MNote is a list of length 1 and can be thought of as a function with no arguments.\newline
An MNote can be represented as \%A, where A refers to any musical note.\newline
$>$ \%A \newline
~note.midi 

When a user enters a single note, the note is evaluated as a function and returns a midi file that contains the musical equivalent of the note.

\section{Input and Output}
The input would consist of one or more notes (Frequency and time), instruments (*are we decided on this*).
The output would be a .midi file which you can play and listen to.

\section{MLang Expressions}
The common form of an MLang expression is a function application given by the syntax 
(function arg1 arg2 ...) 
where the arguments can be MNotes or other functions

\subsection{Functions as values}
Since MLang is a functional language, functions can be treated as data that can be passed around.
In MLang, all functions are evaluated to notes. Thus every function eventually is evaluated to a string of notes that forms the midi.

\section{Writing Your first MLang Program}
A program in MLang is nothing but a sequence of functions. A simple program to play a trill would look like this-

$>$(play (trill C))
.midi ---$>$ alternating B \& C

The file can be written in any editor and should be saved as something like trill.mlang. (*I wasnt sure on this*)
