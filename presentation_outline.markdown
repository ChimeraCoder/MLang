* Why homoiconicity?


[Insert picture of Bach here - any picture will do]


Defining Characteristics (Motivation)

Dan's Demo
-----------

Dan can take a shot at writing some MLang



Live Demonstration with Dan
---------------------------

* I've been able to enlist the help of a very talented musician with no programming background whatsoever. He has offered to demonstrate how a non-programmer would be able to use our language.
** One way we can do this is to write the entirety of a program except for one key component - the bassline, the chorus, etc. We can write a simple little version of that missing piece on the spot, play it, and say that it 'doesn't sound right', at which point Dan can step in, compose a more aesthetically-pleasing bass line/chorus/etc., and then compile it with the part that we've written on the spot).
* This will do wonders for addressing the concern that our language may not be accessible/useful to non-programmers.
* In order for this to work, someone should compose the sample piece in question. Ideally, Dan should only have to compose a single line (a few notes at most) - the intent is to demonstrate that what is possible.
